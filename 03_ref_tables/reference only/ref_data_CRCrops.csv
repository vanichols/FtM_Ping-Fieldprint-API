Values of Specific leaf weight measured in the paper varied from 2.15 to 4.3, with early season growth mostly in the area of 2.15 to 2.72 mg/cm^2
Conversion to m^2/kg is * 10^6 mg/kg * 10^-4 m^2/cm^2 = 100 / mg/cm^2

2.15 mg/cm^2 = 100 / 2.15 m^2/kg = 46.5 m^2/kg, 100 / 2.72 = 36.8, 100 / 4.3 = 23.3

Stem densities for the MO94 study (data not presented) were not different among seeding rates at any sampling time. There were 623 stems m–2 13 MAP
and only 350 stems m–2 by 25 MAP. Stem density remained nearly constant at that level through 49 MAP. During the same time period, plant density
declined from an average of 100 down to 25 plants m–2. This means that there was a fourfold increase in stems per plant from 25 to 49 MAP during
the same time period. Thereafter, stem density continued to decline to 290 and 260 stems m–2 at 63 and 73 MAP, respectively, while plant density fell
below 15 plants m–2 during the same time period. Crowns develop stems in response to light (Cowett and Sprague, 1962) and apparently could not
continue to maintain high stem density with the thin stand and older plants.

The biomass adjustment factor has been set to 1.0 from the 0.6 that Fred had.  The biomass conversion eff factor was moved from 30 to 24 to match yield
of the standard alfalfa run in Moses Lake, WA and now in Yuma, AZ.  The record runs a little under the 6 ton/ac yield in ML, and somewhat over the 10 t/ac for
Yuma.  The seed weight was increased from 0.00007 to 0.0006 to increase the intial growth of the fall planting.There is about 1500 lbs of growth going into
winter in WA and about 2400 lbs/ac at the first harvest in AZ.    Yuma will need to lower the Biomass Adjustment factor to 0.8 to get the 12 t/ac yield needed.
